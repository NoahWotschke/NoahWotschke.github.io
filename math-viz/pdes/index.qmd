### Overview

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical phenomena across engineering and physics. The equations and analytical solutions below represent the most important classical PDEs I studied during my Analysis III course at ETH.

## PDE Classes

**Parabolic PDEs** describe diffusion and heat transfer processes that evolve towards steady-state over time.

**Elliptic PDEs** describe steady-state phenomena where no time dependence exists.

**Hyperbolic PDEs** describe wave propagation and oscillatory phenomena.

## Explore Individual PDEs

### The [Heat Equation](heat/index.html)
**Parabolic / Time-Dependent**

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u$$

The heat equation describes how temperature diffuses through space over time. Explore finite and infinite domain solutions, including Fourier transform and heat kernel methods.

### The [Laplace Equation](laplace/index.html)
**Elliptic / Steady-State**

$$\nabla^2 u = 0$$

The Laplace equation describes steady-state potential fields with no source term. Solutions cover both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

### The [Poisson Equation](poisson/index.html)
**Elliptic / Steady-State**

$$\nabla^2 u = f$$

The Poisson equation extends the Laplace equation with a source term $f$, modeling phenomena like electrostatics and gravitational fields.

### The [Wave Equation](wave/index.html)
**Hyperbolic / Time-Dependent**

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u$$

The wave equation describes wave propagation through space and time. Solutions include standing waves in finite domains and traveling waves in infinite domains.

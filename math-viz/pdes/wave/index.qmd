## Wave Equation (Hyperbolic / Time-Dependent)

The wave equation is a hyperbolic PDE that describes the propagation of waves through space.

### Equation

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u$$

where $u$ is displacement, $c$ is wave speed, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

### Solutions

This section covers various solutions to the wave equation:
- Finite Domain (Standing Waves)
  - 1D String (Separation of Variables)
  - 2D Membrane (Separation of Variables in Polar/Cartesian)
- Infinite Domain (Traveling Waves)
  - 1D (D'Alembert's Formula)
  - 2D (Method of Descent / Poisson)
  - 3D (Kirchhoff's Formula)

## Heat Equation (Parabolic / Time-Dependent)

The heat equation is a fundamental parabolic partial differential equation that describes how heat diffuses through space over time.

### Equation

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u$$

where $u(x,t)$ is temperature, $\alpha$ is thermal diffusivity, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

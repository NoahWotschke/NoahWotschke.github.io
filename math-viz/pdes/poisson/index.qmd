The Poisson equation is an elliptic PDE that extends the Laplace equation to include a source term.

### Equation

$$\nabla^2 u = f$$

where $u$ is a potential function, $f$ is a source term, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

### Solutions

This section covers various solutions to the Poisson equation:
- Dirichlet Boundary Conditions (Prescribed Value)

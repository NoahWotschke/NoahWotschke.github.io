**Second-year Mechanical Engineering Student | ETH Zurich**

This website acts as a personal archive of my work in engineering and mathematics. I use this space to document my projects—from academic research to private coding experiments. My goal is to capture the learning process and showcase the underlying logic of the systems I study.

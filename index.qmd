This website acts as a personal archive of my work in engineering and mathematics. I use this space to document my projects—from academic research to private coding experiments. My goal is to capture the learning process and showcase the underlying logic of the systems I study.

### Featured Work

**[Math-Viz: PDE Visualization Framework](math-viz/index.html)** - A comprehensive tool for solving and visualizing Partial Differential Equations with real-time 3D rendering. Includes detailed mathematical derivations and numerical solution methods for heat, Laplace, Poisson, and wave equations.
